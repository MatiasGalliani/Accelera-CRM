âœ… Bug fixed successfully in syncService.js!

The bug was in the code that auto-assigned lead sources to new agents.
Before the fix, all new agents (not just admins) would automatically get
all lead sources including AIFIDI.

The fix:
1. Modified the code to only auto-assign sources to admin accounts
2. Added a check that prevents auto-assignment of sources to regular agents

Changes made:
- Lines 91-107 in backend/services/syncService.js
- Added a role check to only assign sources automatically to admins
- Added an explicit log message when NOT assigning sources to regular agents

This fix ensures that:
1. New regular agents will NOT get any lead sources by default
2. Admin accounts will still get all sources
3. Manual source assignments through Firestore will still work correctly

The next time a new agent is created, they will NOT get AIFIDI automatically.
